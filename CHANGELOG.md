## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Human-in-the-loop upload review** — upload preview is now an editable table where each row can have its merchant name and category corrected inline before import
- **"Apply to Similar" bulk override** — correct one transaction and propagate the same category to all rows with the same merchant in a single click
- **Per-row "Learn" toggle** — choose per transaction whether a manual correction should train future categorization
- **Learning Center** (Settings page) — displays feedback event stats (total, future-learning, overrides, uncategorized remaining) and a feed of recent manual corrections; includes a "Reapply to history" action to re-categorize past transactions when rules or overrides evolve
- **Custom Rules engine UI** (Settings page) — renamed from "Categorization Rules" to "Your Custom Rules" with clarifying copy; empty state now explains that Spectra categorizes automatically without custom rules
- **Rule management** — toggle active/inactive per rule, reorder priority with ↑/↓ buttons, inline test panel showing historical impact before saving
- **Actionable insights panel** (Dashboard) — surfaces anomaly signals (unusual spend, new recurring, price changes) as linked cards
- **Price-change detection** (Subscriptions page) — badges and inline banner highlight subscriptions whose amount changed vs. prior period
- `httpx>=0.27.0` added as an explicit runtime dependency (used by `fx.py` for ECB rate fetching)
- Python 3.13 added to supported classifiers

### Changed
- Layout centering fixed across all pages — content now respects a `max-width: 1200px` container centered in the main area (`main-inner` wrapper)
- `architecture.md` updated to reflect web upload flow, Custom Rules engine, Human-in-the-loop layer, Learning Center, and expanded dashboard pages
- License corrected in `pyproject.toml` from MIT to AGPL-3.0-or-later (LICENSE file was always AGPL)

### Fixed
- All dashboard sub-pages had content shifted left due to missing `margin: auto` on the max-width container

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Full local mode** — categorization now runs entirely on-device with no cloud calls required when `AI_PROVIDER=local`
- **4-layer cascade** — merchant memory → fuzzy matching (rapidfuzz) → ML classifier → Uncategorized fallback
- **On-device ML classifier** — TF-IDF + Logistic Regression trained on ~300 seed examples, then learns from your own transaction history with 10× weight; confidence threshold ≥ 0.20
- **Local web dashboard** — browse transactions, categories, trends and budgets at `localhost:8080` (FastAPI + Jinja2)
  - Dashboard page with summary cards and charts
  - Transactions table with inline category editing
  - Budget monthly targets vs actuals
  - Trends month-over-month comparison
  - Subscriptions recurring detection
  - Settings (theme, cycle, AI provider, DB stats)
  - Upload drag-and-drop for CSV/PDF
- **Dark / light / auto theme** — follows system preference or manual override, persisted to server
- **Configurable financial cycle** — pay-day aware monthly cycle (1-28th of month)

### Changed
- OpenAI/Gemini still supported as alternative providers via `AI_PROVIDER=openai|gemini`

---

## [0.1.0] — initial release

### Added
- **CLI pipeline** — `python -m spectra` ingests bank exports (CSV/PDF), normalizes messy formats, and stores in SQLite
- **Optional LLM categorization** — OpenAI/Gemini via `AI_PROVIDER=openai|gemini` for cloud-based transaction categorization and merchant name cleaning
- **Idempotent imports** — SQLite + content hashes avoid duplicate transactions across repeated imports
- **Recurring detection** — tags subscriptions and recurring income based on temporal patterns and static criteria
- **Historical FX conversion** — multi-currency support via Frankfurter API (ECB rates, free, no API key required)
- **Google Sheets sync** — updates a multi-tab dashboard (Transactions, Dashboard, Trends); runs locally or via GitHub Actions
- **CSV and PDF support** — parses exports from any bank
- **AGPL-3.0** — fully open source

### Notes
- Core pipeline runs locally; LLM runs in the cloud depending on provider (no local ML yet)
